OPTIONAL Pathfinding issue:

I want to have a tidy way of defining what are the tiles in the scene.
This may include tiles in a tile grid generator, or manual tiles.
But, the most natural way to implement a pre-defined set of tiles,
	is with two data pieces:
1. The base layout of the room, which is only the floor tiles, excluding NPCs, furnitures and such.
2. A set of entities: NPCs, furtnirues and such, which is added ON TOP of the previous dataset of the room layout tiles.

Instead of a grid generator, I want set of tiles, each with a position relative to the origin position, (0,0).
[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1)]
These tiles will all be walkable.

Things like walls and other objects that also should belong in the base layout, will currently not be considered.

Then, given that set of tiles, we will have a second set of tiles, defined by a JSON string.
{
	tiles: [
		{pos: [4, 5], tileTypeID: "Seller", tileData: {}},
		{pos: [2, 3.5], tileTypeID: "Sold Goods Stand", tileData: {
			goodTypeID: "Bowie Knife",
			goodQuantity: 4
		}},
		{pos: [3, 4.5], tileTypeID: "Cashier Line", tileData: {}}
	]
}
